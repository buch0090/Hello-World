Green Bay â€” Vince Young was in no mood to spike the football on Sunday. He has been banished by teams before, abandoned to quarterback purgatory. Momentum can be reversed at any moment.

"I really feel like the job is still up in the air right now," said Young.

So, no, the comeback is not yet complete.

The Packers have presumably moved forward with a quarterback who's been in town three weeks over one that's been around three-plus years. But one day after Graham Harrell's release, the quarterback derby continues between Young and B.J. Coleman. One exhibition game to go, Young still needs to cross the finish line.

It's not quite Pasadena in 2006. But Thursday night is essentially the Vince Young Bowl.

The former national champion has one more hurdle to clear.

"We have two quarterbacks here," coach Mike McCarthy said. "And the No. 2 spot hasn't been answered. That's where we are. B.J. and Vince are going to compete and take the majority of this football game."
