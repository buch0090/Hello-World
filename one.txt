The former national champion has one more hurdle to clear.

"We have two quarterbacks here," coach Mike McCarthy said. "And the No. 2 spot hasn't been answered. That's where we are. B.J. and Vince are going to compete and take the majority of this football game."

The 6-foot-5, 230-pound Young and 6-foot-3, 231-pound Coleman have both steered the offense to the end zone on long, efficient touchdown drives this preseason. Soon after arriving, though, Young took snaps ahead of the 2012 seventh-rounder in practice and on game day. To reach this point — on the verge of making a 53-man roster after face-planting in Buffalo and spending all of 2012 out of football — Young needed to cram quickly.

He compared this cram session to the one he had in Philadelphia out of the lockout.

Working with quarterbacks coach Ben McAdoo, he learned quick enough to make Harrell expendable.

"You can't do anything but study, study, study, stay in the book, ask questions," Young said. "That's pretty much all you can do. When you get the reps, you want to learn from it and get in the film room and watch it over again and listen to Coach Benny tell you some things you can do get better at with your feet or your progressions.

"It's about film work and more reps and getting more plays and getting more comfortable with the offense."

Learning the playbook matters. Grasping McCarthy's acute footwork does, too. But so does excelling in his element. Young's package of plays against Seattle catered to his strengths, his playmaking ability. Working out of the shotgun, Young spotted a crease here, a crease there and scrambled for 21 and 18 yards. He rolled out of play action to hit Andrew Quarless for 16 yards. He threw a touchdown pass to cap the drive.
